## Enhanced Fallback System:
The system now supports multiple fallback levels:
1. City-specific MP4 video
2. City-specific WebM video (for better browser compatibility)
3. Default fallback video (`default-city.mp4`)
4. Static hero image (final fallback)

## Technical Implementation:
- Videos are loaded with multiple `<source>` elements for browser compatibility
- Automatic fallback to static images if all video sources fail
- Videos are set to autoplay, muted, and looped
- Optimized loading with `preload="metadata"`
- Responsive design with `object-cover` for all screen sizes

## Usage:
Videos are automatically loaded by the CityPageTemplate component based on the city slug.
The system intelligently handles missing videos and provides seamless fallbacks.

## Performance Notes:
- Videos are lazy-loaded and optimized for web delivery
- Gradient overlays ensure text readability over videos
- Mobile-friendly with `playsInline` attribute
- Error handling prevents broken video displays

## Replacement Instructions:
To replace placeholder videos with actual footage:
1. Record/source high-quality video content following the guidelines
2. Edit to 15-30 seconds with seamless loop points
3. Encode as MP4 (H.264) with web optimization
4. Keep file size under 8MB
5. Replace the corresponding placeholder file
6. Test across different browsers and devices
